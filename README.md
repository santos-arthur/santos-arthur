# Arthur Santos 😄👋

## Yo, what's up! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Arthur Santos, a code enthusiast based in Brazil. Currently, I'm working as a **Software Engineer**, bringing my skills and enthusiasm to the table. I started my coding journey back in 2018 and have been hooked ever since! 🚀

## Skills 🛠️

Here are some of the tools in my coding backpack:

- **Main Stack**: PHP 🐘, Node.js 🚀, Python 🐍  
- **Frameworks**: Laravel 🏗️, NestJs 🐈  
- **Other Skills**: Docker 🐳, MySQL 🗃️, React ⚛️, NextJS 🔼, Tailwind 🎨  
- **Project Management**: Git 🐈‍⬛, Scrum 📋, Agile 🔄️  

## What I'm Currently Studying 📚

I’m expanding my knowledge of **software architecture**, diving into how to design more robust, scalable systems. I’m also **deepening my skills** in the languages and frameworks I already know—especially Python for data analysis and machine learning. Additionally, I'm **focusing on Next.js with Node.js and NestJS with React**, aiming to become even more versatile in full-stack development. 🐍🚀

## Current Role & Experience 🎯

- **Software Engineer**: I focus on designing, building, and delivering robust, scalable solutions.  
- **Release Manager (Past Role)**: I gained valuable insights ensuring smooth releases and refining development workflows—experience I still leverage to keep projects on track.  
- **Technical Leadership Tasks**: Although I didn’t hold the official title of Tech Lead, I was actively involved in answering technical questions, making key decisions, and managing our repository, sprints, and releases.  

All of these responsibilities have shaped my skill set and taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement in tech. ⚙️🚀
